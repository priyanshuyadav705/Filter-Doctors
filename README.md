<h1 align="center">Welcome to Filtering General Doctors ðŸ‘‹</h1>

> A Doctor Consultation Web App built using **Next.js**, **Flask**, and **SQL**. It allows users to browse and book appointments with specialized doctors (e.g., General Physicians, Cardiologists) through a clean, modern interface. The app includes various filters to help users find doctors based on their preferences, such as gender, specialization, language, and fee range. The backend is designed to handle doctor data and provides REST APIs to manage doctors' listings.
